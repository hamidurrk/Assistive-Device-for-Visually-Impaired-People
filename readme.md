# Assistive Device for Visually Impaired People

To assist visually impaired people in reading, this hand-glove-like device helps the peoson to understand a sentence by converting the string into a group of correlated braille cells. Up untill now, it can receive strings via bluetooth (HC-05 module), processes the data in a microcontroller (ESP32) and control the vibration motors meshed into the fabric of the hand glove.

Hoping to improve more in future.
