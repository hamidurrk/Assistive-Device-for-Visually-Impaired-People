# Assistive Device for Visually Impaired People

To assist visually impaired people in reading text from any kind of digital platform, this hand-glove-like device helps the person to understand a char by converting it into a 3x2 dot matrix braille cell. Up untill now, it can receive strings via bluetooth, processes the data in a microcontroller (ESP32) and control the 6 vibration motors meshed into the fabric of the index and middle finger of the hand glove.

Hoping to improve more in future.
